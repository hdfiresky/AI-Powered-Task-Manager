# AI-Powered Task Manager

![AI Task Manager](https://storage.googleapis.com/project-avis/Task-Manager-Banner.png)

A modern, responsive task management application built with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. This app helps users organize their tasks with status tracking, priority setting, and a powerful AI-driven feature to break down complex tasks into smaller, manageable sub-tasks using the **Google Gemini API**.

## üöÄ Getting Started

There are two ways to run this project. For a quick demo, you can run the frontend directly. For a more secure and production-ready setup, it is highly recommended to run the included FastAPI backend.

### Option 1: Frontend-Only (Quick Demo)

This method runs the entire application in the browser. It's fast to set up but requires placing your API key directly in the frontend code, which is **not secure for production**.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd <repository-directory>
    ```

2.  **Configure API Key:**
    Open the `index.html` file. Find the `<script>` block with `window.process` and replace the empty string with your Google Gemini API key:
    ```html
    <script>
      window.process = { 
        env: { 
          // IMPORTANT: PASTE YOUR GEMINI API KEY HERE
          API_KEY: "YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE" 
        } 
      };
    </script>
    ```
    > **‚ö†Ô∏è Security Warning:** Never commit your API key to version control. This method is for local testing only.

3.  **Run the application:**
    Since this project uses ES modules, you'll need a simple local server to run it.
    - If you have Python installed:
      ```bash
      python -m http.server
      ```
    - If you have Node.js and `serve` installed (`npm install -g serve`):
      ```bash
      serve .
      ```
    Now, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8000` (or the URL provided by your server).

### Option 2: Frontend + Secure Backend (Recommended)

This approach uses a Python-based FastAPI server to handle all communication with the Gemini API. Your API key remains secure on the server, and the frontend communicates with your backend.

For detailed instructions, please refer to the backend setup guide:
**‚û°Ô∏è [Guide: Creating a Secure FastAPI Backend](fastapi_backend.md)**

A summary of the steps is below:

1.  **Set up the Backend:**
    - Navigate to the `task-manager-backend` directory (or create one as per the guide).
    - Create and activate a Python virtual environment.
    - Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
    - Create a `.env` file and add your API key: `GEMINI_API_KEY="YOUR_KEY_HERE"`
    - Run the server: `uvicorn main:app --reload` (or use `docker-compose up --build`). The backend will run on `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

2.  **Prepare the Frontend:**
    - **No API key is needed in the frontend code!** You can remove the `window.process` script block from `index.html`.
    - The `services/geminiService.ts` file is already configured to send requests to `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

3.  **Run the Frontend:**
    - Start a local server for the frontend files as described in Option 1.
    - Open the frontend in your browser. All AI features will now be securely powered by your backend.
